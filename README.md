## Recoloring for Windows Client [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

This fork contains a fix for the strong pink background tint until there will be an official color change.
The pink accent from the rebranding is still in here, but just as an accent. I will be trying to keep it up to date with the original repo.

Feel free to use my repo as an inspiration to do even more recoloring :)

## Build on Windows

Install Visual Studio 2019 with `.NET desktop development`, `Desktop development with C++` and `Universal Windows Platform development` components checked during installation. You can download free Visual Studio Community [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

Then open the solution file `src\ui\windows\TogglDesktop\TogglDesktop.sln` and run it in `Debug` mode.

The executable can then be found in e.g. src\ui\windows\TogglDesktop\TogglDesktop\bin\x64\Debug\
